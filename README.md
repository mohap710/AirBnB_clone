# AirBnB_clone

Airbnb Clone is a technical solution to entrepreneurs for launching their own rental marketplace platform faster into the market. It is equipped with essential features to run a marketplace where customers can share their properties and also goods easily.

HBNB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, HTML/CSS templating, API, front-end and others.

This team project is part of the ALX School Software Engineering program. It represents the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone.

This first step consists of:

a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data.

## Usage

The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell. It prints a prompt (hbnb) and waits for the user for input.

### 1. Interactive mode

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

### 2. non-nteractive mode

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```

Files and Directories models directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance. tests directory will contain all unit tests. console.py file is the entry point of our command interpreter. models/base_model.py file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements: attributes: id, created_at and updated_at methods: save() and to_json() models/engine directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: file_storage.py.
